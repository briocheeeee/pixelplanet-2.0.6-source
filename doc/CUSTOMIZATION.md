# Customization

## Logos

To use your own Logo, change `./public/logo.svg` and rebuild.

**NOTE**: The logo [that comes with this repository](../public/logo.svg), is free to use. But the https://pixelplanet.fun logo is an unregistered trademark, you are not allowed to copy or modify it for your own purposes.

## Styles

To add more css styles, create a new css file in `src/styles` based on `src/styles/default.css` with a filename beginning with "theme-" and rebuild.
